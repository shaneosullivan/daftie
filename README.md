# dafty

Unofficial browser extension to improve the daft.ie property search website.

Searching for a property to rent or buy is a time consuming effort usually over
a long period of time. Daft.ie is a great website for doing this in Ireland,
as it is the default site that every puts their property on. However, the
search experience leaves something to be desired, which this extension improves.

## Features

- _Hide properties that you never want to see again_. This can be useful if you
  have one or more searches that you look through regularly for changes,
  and you don't want to be distracted by properties you've already taken out of
  consideration.
- _Take notes on the search page_. Remind yourself of important facts regarding
  a property, e.g. that you've emailed the landlord, that you have an
  appointment etc.
- _Quickly read the property details_. From the search page, read the property
  details without having to open a new page.
- _View photos_. From the search page, look at the photos for the property
  without having to open a new page.
- _Auto-Paginate_. By default Daft just shows you 20 results per page. Often
  this is not enough, and you find yourself paging through screen after screen.
  This extension instead auto-fetches up to ten pages and puts them all on the
  screen to be scrolled through immediately. This gives you up to 200 results
  per screen. If there are more than 200 results, you can still click the _Next_
  button to see them. Allied with the _Hide_ feature, this enables you to
  quickly scan over a regular search for any interesting changes, hiding those
  you're not interested in and quickly spotting any new additions.
